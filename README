Rails 3 nifty generators based on efforts by ryanb and dvyjones.
The generators use the very DRY rails 3 conventions as described by ryanb

The gem comes with executables that can be found in the /bin folder
  nifty_auth
  nifty_config
  nifty_layout
  
Scaffold:  
  nifty_scaffold [model:string] [attributes:hash]

  $ nifty_scaffold Person name:string birthdate:date

Application:
  nifty_app [application name]

  $ nifty_app my_best_app

The executables are installed when the gem is installed on your system
$ sudo gem install very_nifty_generators

Note: More nifty generators for rails 3 are in the pipelineâ€¦ feel free to come with suggestions.

Also check out my monog_model_r3 gem with generators for use with mongo DB ;)
